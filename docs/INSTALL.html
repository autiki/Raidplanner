<h1>Description</h1>

		<div class="content">
		<p>A Raid planner for your phpBB3 / bbDKP forum.</p>
		
		
		<p>forked from Alightner's Calendar mod, modified to work with bbDKP.</p>
		the base code was refactored into functional classes. 
		<p>hooks into the bbDKP event and guildmembers Table, so bbDKP 1.2 must be installed before.</p>
		<p>It has an UMIL Database installer, and so is database independent.</p>
		
		<h2>Raid Feature list</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Raid Events pick up new Raid icons from DKP event. </li>
		<li>Sign up with your Guild characters to raids</li>
		<li>Follow up to which raid(s) you signed up from your UCP.</li>
		<li>3 Event types exist : Public events (no signup), Raid events (Signup), and personal events. Raid Events are picked up from bbDKP. 
		  Public events and Personal events are set up in Raidplanner.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Calendar Feature list</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Includes both All Day and Timed Events </li>
		<li>Views
		<ul>
		<li>Event View - filled with all event details (who's invited, who created the event, BBCode, Smilies, start and end times, edit & delete buttons if applicable etc) </li>
		<li>Month View - can jump to any month via next and prev links, or jump randomly via pulldown menus. Lists birthdays, event types and event names only. Click on the day's number to add a new event on that day</li>
		<li>Week View - can jump to any week via next and prev links, or jump randomly via pulldown menus. Lists birthdays, event types, names, and times. Click on the day's number to add a new event on that day.</li>
		<li>Day View - can jump to any day via next and prev links, or jump randomly via pulldown menus. Includes a Graphical display of events on a timeline - lets you quickly see schedule conflicts etc. Lists birthdays, event types, names, and times. Click on the day's number to add a new event on that day.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>Support for BBCode and Smilies </li>
		<li>Birthday Support - Using phpBB3 Birthdays </li>
		<li>Make events bold if you are event creator - Let's you quickly see events most important to you.</li>
		<li>List of Upcoming Events on index - in the ACP you can specify whether or not you want to display the upcoming events on the index (and if so how many events to list). You also have the option to list the current week view on the index.</li>
		<li>Detailed Permissions - You can control who has permission to view, create, edit, delete, and moderate events. </li>
		<li>Auto pruning of past events - From the ACP you control how often events are pruned, and how old they have to be before they are added to the delete list.</li>
		<li>Recurring events - events will be occurrenceable with 12 different options:
		
		<ol>
		<li>A: Day [X] of [Month Name] every [Y] Year(s)</li>
		<li>A: [Xth] [Weekday Name] of [Month Name] every [Y] Year(s)</li>
		<li>A: [Xth] [Weekday Name] of full weeks in [Month Name] every [Y] Year(s)</li>
		<li>A: [Xth from last] [Weekday Name] of [Month Name] every [Y] Year(s)</li>
		<li>A: [Xth from last] [Weekday Name] of full weeks in [Month Name] every [Y] Year(s)</li>
		<li>M: Day [X] of month every [Y] Month(s)</li>
		<li>M: [Xth] [Weekday Name] of month every [Y] Month(s)</li>
		<li>M: [Xth] [Weekday Name] of full weeks in month every [Y] Month(s)</li>
		<li>M: [Xth from last] [Weekday Name] of month every [Y] Month(s)</li>
		<li>M: [Xth from last] [Weekday Name] of full weeks in month every [Y] Month(s)</li>
		<li>W: [Weekday Name] every [Y] Week(s)</li>
		<li>D: Every [Y] Day(s)</li>
		</ol>
		
		</li>
		
		<li>The user gets to enter the frequency [Y] value, and the other value's in []'s are interpolated 
		from the user's selected start date. </li>
		
		<li>There is a new user permission setting to determine which users have permission to create recurring events.</li>
		
		<li>Recurring events can be deleted individually, or all events of the recurring group can be deleted together. 
		Recurring events can be edited individually (including start/end time settings, but not recurring event settings) 
		or you can edit the whole group of events altogether. If you're editing the whole group of recurring events - 
		you will not be able to edit any of the scheduling data, you'll only have access to the subject, body, i
		nvite list, and registration (signup) settings.</li>
		
		<li>When creating a recurring event you can specify the last day of the event group, or you can specify 
		the recurring event as never ending.</li>
		
		<li>Recurring events are populated by a cron job, and you can edit how often the cron job runs in the ACP. 
		You can also specify in the ACP how many days into the future you want to have populated in the calendar at a time.</li>
		
		<li>Event Registration - When creating new events, users have the option to enable attendance tracking 
		which allows users to register for the event. The event creator can also specify whether forum members are allowed 
		to bring guests to this event. When viewing the event, users are prompted to register for the event, and if guests 
		are allowed they can specify how many people they are bringing to the event so the calendar can track the total 
		headcount for the event. Permissions can be used to control who has permission to create events with attendance 
		tracking, and who is able to see what information gathered from users registering for the event.
		 Users are allowed to leave comments with their "yes", "no", or"maybe" reply, and the comments support smilies, bbcode, etc.</li>
		
		<li>Ability to invite multiple groups to an event</li>
		
		<li>Custom date/time formatting controlled in calendar ACP - this overwrites the user's preferred
		 date/time format, so you can display just the time in hours where it makes sense (like in the week view) 
		 or the whole date+time (like in the display event)</li>		
		 
		<li>Ability to display events only on their start date - obviously the day view is a graphical display of 
		 all things going on, and events will display in the day view even if not on the start date with this
		  setting turned on. However it's great for things like a week view with an event that starts at
		   10pm and ends at 2am the next day, because it will only display on the first day.</li>																			

	
		<li>Ability to display a list of upcoming events for the next X days </li>
		
		<li>Detailed display for calendar on who is online page </li>
		
		<li>New permission option to invite groups you're not a member of - if this is turned on, you'll be able to create events for groups 
		you don't belong to, but the author of the event will always be able to see their own events - even if they don't belong to the invite list.</li>
		
		<li>Detailed permissions for ability to create private, group, or public events - now you can give some users the power to
		 create public events, and others only permission to create private events, or whatever combination makes sense for your forum.</li>
		
		<li>Utility in ACP to move all events +/- one hour (helps when changing forum's dst setting). When you create an event 
		it's stored in an absolute time, and if the forum (and/or users) change their dst settings they may suddenly
		 see all the events appear off by one hour, now there's a utility to move ALL events in the calendar forward or
		  back by one hour to help correct things when you change your DST.</li>
		
		<li>Ability to filter the calendar for events of a specific type - currently there's no UI for this, 
		it's simply a matter of adding a calEType argument to the URL. The user who requested this feature 
		sounded like they would create links to "different" calendars on their forum, where each 
		calendar only displayed events of the specified type.</li>
		
		<li>UCP module that displays upcoming events (that the user has registered for) for the next X days.</li>
		
		<li>UCP module that displays upcoming events (that the user has created) for the next X days.</li>
		
		<li>Ability to "Watch" the calendar - users can elect to watch the calendar for email notifications when new 
		events are created (that they are invited to).  The user is sent one notification when a new event 
		is created, but no new notifications for new events are sent until they re-visit the calendar
		 (much like how notifications are sent for forums you "subscribe" to).</li>
		
		<li>Ability to "Watch" a specific event for updates and/or replies.  Users can elect to watch a specific event
		 for update notifications whenever the event creator updates the event information or other users update thier reply 
		 (registration) for the event.  Note if the user doesn't have permission to view detailed event replies - they will not
		  receive the email notifications when other users reply to an event, but they will still recieve the email notifications
		   when the event poster updates the event information.</li>
